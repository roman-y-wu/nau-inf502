Git is a distributed VCS where each clone contains the complete repository history.\n\n2. ✅ **git push, git pull, git fetch are commands used to work with a remote repository**\n   - This is correct. These commands are specifically for interacting with remote repositories.\n\n3. ✅ **Git clone is used to copy an existing Git repository into a new local directory**\n   - This is correct. `git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository.\n\n4. ✅ **GitHub fork is a copy of a GitHub repository to another account on GitHub**\n   - This is correct. Forking creates a copy of a repository under your own GitHub account.\n\n**Incorrect Answers:**\n\n- ❌ You need to be connected to the internet to make a \"git commit\"\n  - False. Git commit is a local operation and doesn't require internet.\n\n- ❌ If I want to create a new branch called \"bug123\" I would type \"git add -branch bug123\"\n  - False. The correct command is `git branch bug123` or `git checkout -b bug123`.\n\n- ❌ Git is actually a nickname for GitHub\n  - False. Git and GitHub are different. Git is a version control system; GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories."

   "source": "---\n\n## Short Answer 2: The 4 Values of the Agile Manifesto\n\n**Question:** What are the 4 values outlined by the Agile Manifesto? Briefly explain each of them.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n### 1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools\n\nThis value emphasizes that the people involved in software development and how they communicate are more important than rigid processes or fancy tools. While processes and tools are helpful, they should support the team rather than dictate how they work. Effective collaboration and communication lead to better outcomes.\n\n### 2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation\n\nThis value prioritizes delivering functional software that actually works over producing extensive documentation. While documentation is still important, the primary measure of progress is working software. The focus should be on building something that users can actually use and get value from.\n\n### 3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation\n\nThis value encourages ongoing collaboration with customers throughout the development process, rather than relying solely on fixed contracts or specifications defined at the start. Requirements can change, and continuous customer feedback helps ensure the final product meets actual needs.\n\n### 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan\n\nThis value acknowledges that change is inevitable in software development. Rather than strictly following a predetermined plan, agile teams should be flexible and adapt to new requirements, feedback, or market conditions. Being responsive to change leads to better products that meet current needs."

Both Lean and Scrum are well-known agile methodologies.\n\n2. ✅ **One of the Agile principles states that \"Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication\"**\n   - This is correct. This is one of the 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto.\n\n3. ✅ **Kanban is a practice adopted by agile methods in which a board with cards is used to visualize the flow of work**\n   - This is correct. Kanban boards help teams visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency.\n\n**Incorrect Answers:**\n\n- ❌ Agile development was created to make software development faster\n  - False. Agile was created to make development more flexible, customer-focused, and responsive to change, not just faster.\n\n- ❌ When using SCRUM, you need to make sure that the clients will have no access to prototypes, only the final product\n  - False. Scrum encourages regular feedback and collaboration with customers, including access to prototypes and incremental deliveries.\n\n- ❌ Extreme Programming is just a new way of programming and has nothing to do with agile methods\n  - False. Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the original agile methodologies."

   "source": "---\n\n## Short Answer 3: Why are Unit Tests Important?\n\n**Question:** Why are unit tests important?\n\n**Answer:**\n\nUnit tests are important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Early Bug Detection:** Unit tests help identify bugs early in the development process, when they are easier and cheaper to fix.\n\n2. **Code Quality:** Writing testable code often leads to better-designed, more modular code with clear interfaces.\n\n3. **Refactoring Confidence:** Unit tests provide a safety net when refactoring code, ensuring that changes don't break existing functionality.\n\n4. **Documentation:** Unit tests serve as living documentation that shows how code is intended to be used.\n\n5. **Faster Debugging:** When a test fails, it pinpoints exactly which part of the code has a problem.\n\n6. **Regression Prevention:** Unit tests prevent previously fixed bugs from reappearing.\n\n7. **Continuous Integration:** Unit tests enable automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring code quality with every change."
