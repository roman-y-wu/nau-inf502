        "## Greedy Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "### What They Are\n",
        "Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithmic strategies that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. The key principle is to always choose the option that appears best at the current moment, without considering the long-term consequences or revisiting previous decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How They Work\n",
        "1. **Problem Decomposition**: Break the problem into a series of subproblems\n",
        "2. **Greedy Choice**: At each step, make the choice that seems best at that moment\n",
        "3. **Optimal Substructure**: The problem must have the property that an optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems\n",
        "4. **No Backtracking**: Once a decision is made, it is never reconsidered\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm typically follows this pattern:\n",
        "- Sort items by some criterion (e.g., value-to-weight ratio)\n",
        "- Iteratively add items that fit within constraints\n",
        "- Continue until no more items can be added\n",
        "\n",
        "### Where They May Be Used\n",
        "- **Activity Selection Problem**: Scheduling activities that don't overlap\n",
        "- **Huffman Coding**: Data compression\n",
        "- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Finding the cheapest way to connect all nodes\n",
        "- **Shortest Path (Dijkstra's)**: Finding shortest paths in graphs\n",
        "- **Fractional Knapsack**: When items can be partially taken\n",
        "- **Interval Scheduling**: Allocating resources to time intervals\n",
        "\n",
        "### General Pros and Cons\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Often have good time complexity (O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for selection)\n",
        "- **Low Memory**: Typically require minimal additional space\n",
        "- **Fast Execution**: Quick to run for large datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **Not Always Optimal**: May not find the globally optimal solution\n",
        "- **Local Optimization**: Can get stuck in local optima\n",
        "- **Problem-Specific**: Need to carefully choose the greedy criterion\n",
        "- **No Guarantee**: Cannot guarantee optimality for many problems (like 0/1 Knapsack)\n",

        "## Branch and Bound Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "### What They Are\n",
        "Branch and Bound is an algorithmic paradigm for solving optimization problems, particularly combinatorial optimization problems. It systematically explores the solution space by branching (dividing the problem into subproblems) and bounding (pruning branches that cannot lead to optimal solutions).\n",
        "\n",
        "### How They Work\n",
        "1. **Branching**: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems (e.g., include item or exclude item)\n",
        "2. **Bounding**: Calculate upper/lower bounds for each subproblem\n",
        "3. **Pruning**: Eliminate branches that cannot improve the current best solution\n",
        "4. **Search Strategy**: Use a strategy (DFS, BFS, Best-First) to explore the search tree\n",
        "5. **Termination**: Continue until all branches are explored or pruned\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm maintains:\n",
        "- A search tree of subproblems\n",
        "- A current best solution\n",
        "- Bounds for each node to determine if it's worth exploring\n",
        "\n",
        "### Where They May Be Used\n",
        "- **0/1 Knapsack Problem**: Finding optimal item selection\n",
        "- **Traveling Salesman Problem**: Finding shortest route\n",
        "- **Integer Linear Programming**: Optimization with integer constraints\n",
        "- **Job Scheduling**: Assigning jobs to machines optimally\n",
        "- **Assignment Problems**: Optimal resource allocation\n",
        "- **Cutting Stock Problem**: Minimizing waste in material cutting\n",
        "\n",
        "### General Pros and Cons\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pros:**\n",
        "- **Optimality Guarantee**: Finds the globally optimal solution\n",
        "- **Systematic Exploration**: Ensures no optimal solution is missed\n",
        "- **Pruning Efficiency**: Can eliminate large portions of search space early\n",
        "- **Flexible**: Can be adapted to various optimization problems\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cons:**\n",
        "- **Computational Complexity**: Can be exponential in worst case\n",
        "- **Memory Intensive**: May require storing many nodes in the search tree\n",
        "- **Implementation Complexity**: More difficult to implement correctly\n",
        "- **Slower for Large Problems**: May be too slow for very large instances\n"

        "**My Recommendation: It depends on the requirements, but I would generally choose Greedy for this specific problem.**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Choose **Greedy** when:\n",
        "1. **Problem Size**: Large number of items (> 20-30 items)\n",
        "2. **Time Constraints**: Need fast results (real-time applications)\n",
        "3. **Approximate Solution Acceptable**: 85-95% of optimal is sufficient\n",
        "4. **Resource Constraints**: Limited memory or processing power\n",
        "5. **Frequent Recalculations**: Problem needs to be solved many times with different constraints\n",

        "- She travels monthly, so the problem is solved frequently\n",

        "- The value difference between Greedy and optimal is likely small (few points)\n",

        "#### Choose **Branch and Bound** when:\n",

        "2. **Small Problem Size**: < 20 items (runs fast enough)\n",
        "3. **One-Time Calculation**: Problem solved infrequently\n",

        "5. **Academic/Research Context**: Need to prove optimality\n",

        "A practical solution would be:\n",
        "1. **Start with Greedy** to get a quick, good solution\n",
        "2. **Use Greedy result as lower bound** for Branch and Bound\n",
        "3. **Run Branch and Bound** only if:\n",
        "   - Problem is small enough (< 25 items)\n",
        "   - Time allows (not real-time)\n",

        "**I would implement Greedy as the primary solution** because:\n",
        "- Fast enough for interactive use\n",
        "- Good enough solution quality (typically 90%+ of optimal)\n",
        "- Simple to maintain and modify\n",
